# networking-labs
These labs are the product of a project wherein I was tasked with creating a networking / routing grid consisting of nodes at different port numbers. 
The nodes communicate via DGRAM sockets. Each lab increases in complexity; detailed descriptions can be found in each of the lab's README.
